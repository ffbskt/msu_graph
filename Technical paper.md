# Concept
1) Have big list with test data.  ->  read it with safe functuon and transform to pandas dataframe -> add or create new list with same propertis (like fackulty and course) -> save this list. 

2) (example - basketball group) :
Open small list (basketball group) -> add colums -> add protected range

3) cteate temporary colums and fill it by function wich check other colums
